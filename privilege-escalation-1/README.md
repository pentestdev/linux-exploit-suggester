**Privilege escalation** is the act of exploiting a bug, design flaw or configuration oversight in an operating system or software application to gain elevated access to resources that are normally protected from an application or user.



#### Horizontal vs. Vertical Privilege Escalation

There are two types of privilege escalation:

* **Horizontal privilege escalation**—an attacker expands their privileges by taking over another account and misusing the legitimate privileges granted to the other user. To learn more about horizontal privilege escalation see our guide on lateral movement.
* **Vertical privilege escalation**—an attacker attempts to gain more permissions or access with an existing account they have compromised. For example, an attacker takes over a regular user account on a network and attempts to gain administrative permissions. This requires more sophistication and may take the shape of an Advanced Persistent Threat.

# Low Hanging Passwords

## Low Hanging Passwords

After gaining access, typically perform enumeration on the box: 

Perform simple dir listing

```
dir /b /a /s c:\ > cdirs.txt
```

{% hint style="info" %}
This will give you lots of information. Parse through file instead of looking through disk.
{% endhint %}

After downloading .txt file to the attackers machine open it.

{% code title="notepad cdirs.txt" %}
```bash
Parse for keywords
command: type cdirs.txt | findstr /i passw
After finding interesting file or directory
command: type c:\Users\Fred\Documents\passwords.txt
```
{% endcode %}

One thing to remember is we only enumerated the c:\ drive on the pc. There could be other network drives.

* Command: **net use** \( will list out other shares \)

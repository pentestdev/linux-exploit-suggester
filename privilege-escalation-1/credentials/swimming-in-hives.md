CMD: reg query "HKCU\Software\SimonTatham\Putty\Sessions"

* If user is using PUTTY and save sessions, 
* If session is available you can query into the session
* Look for ProxyUsername & Proxy Password

CMD: Below queries allow you to query for specific word within registry

* reg query HKLM /f password /t REG\_SZ /s
* reg query HKCU /f password /t REG\_SZ /s

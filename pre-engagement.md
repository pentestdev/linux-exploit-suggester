### Red Team Rules of Engagement <a id="red-team-rules-of-engagement"></a>

Red team exercises are meant to provide comprehensive assessments that reflect real-world conditions and demonstrate tangible risks posed by a malicious actor during a legitimate attack. The results of these exercises are intended to be used to improve security awareness and training and to assess levels of security control effectiveness. Please see more about the principles and vision of our red team and the security team as a whole.

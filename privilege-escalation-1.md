# Privilege Escalation

## Low Hanging Passwords

After gaining access, typically perform enumeration on the box: 

Perform simple dir listing

```
dir /b /a /s c:\ > cdirs.txt
```

{% hint style="info" %}
This will give you lots of information. Parse through file instead of looking through disk.
{% endhint %}

After downloading .txt file to the attackers machine open it.

{% code title="notepad cdirs.txt" %}
```bash
Parse for keywords
command: type cdirs.txt | findstr /i passw
```
{% endcode %}

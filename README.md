# Welcome

This is publicly accessible personal notes of @[\_s236\_](https://twitter.com/_s236_) and about my pentesting / red teaming experiments in a controlled environment that involve playing with various tools and techniques used by penetration testers,  red teams and advanced adversaries.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Do not expect everything posted here to be perfect. I am a student of this craft called Pentesting. Blogging to share my knowledge and experience. I will try my best to cover techniques I have used to the best I can.
{% endhint %}

The following sub-pages of this page will explore some of the common offensive security techniques involving gaining code execution, lateral movement, persistence and more. This is my way of learning things - I learn by doing, repeating and taking notes.

Techniques being use have been discovered and shared by other security researchers and I do not claim their ownership. I try to reference the sources I use the best I can, but if you think I've missed something, please get in touch and I will fix it immediately.



## The Goal

The goal of this project is simple - read other researchers work, execute some common/uncommon attacking techniques in a lab environment and:

* understand how the attacks can be performed
* write code to further the understanding of some of the tools and techniques
* see what most common artifacts the techniques leave behind
* try out various industry tools and become more profficient in using them
* take notes for future reference
